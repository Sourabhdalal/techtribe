experience, to have a efficient grading system for the faculties as well as the system would be 
intelligent enough to capture the abnormal activities and hence maintaining the integrity code.

## Scope:

can be recorded properly, also the whole thing will remain online so the exam co-ordinator can keep 
track of the whole exam as well as any mischief done by the students will be notified directly to the 
examiner and resulting to termination of the exam.

## Definitions:
	OAS: Online Asssessment System
	Portal: Peronalized Online Examination Environment
	UFI: User Friendly Interface
	SM: Staff Management
	MIS: Management Information System
	SI:  System Intelligence
	Dashboard: Personalized information presented using  SI techniques such as facial recogination,
	eye movement, visualizations, feedback reports, capturing moves

## Functional Requirements:

Every student will have thir own seperate user id and password generated by the system before
examination. For felxibility of time the students will have an option to login 15 minutes before the
exam so that they will also have some time for reading of the instructions and explore the portal 
in a demo mode so that they will be familiar enough during the examination resulting in less wastage of 
time. 
The login process will follow a facial recognition and proper authentication using some 3rd party
software for scanning the iris so that no other student will be able to attend another student exam 
and hence keeping the examination code of conduct.
Whenever the examination starts a timer facility will be there ao that the student can keep the track of 
time and attend the questions accordingly. Now the timer will also be giving a notification whenever an hr is completed \
and when the last 15 minutes are left an message prompt will come there on the screen. 

There will be a side panel displaying all the sections and the marks of that each section will also be
provided there. The student will have the flexibility to toggle around the sections from that side panel
eliminating the need to scroll. Also the section will have a sub part dispalying the question numbers soif the student 
at any point feels to just jump over a particular question, he/she can do so.

The system will have an automatic detection where it highlights the questions which are not attempted by
the student, so that at the last momement the student can just see which questions are not attempted resulting 
in time saving and productivity. As well as the student can mark a question by him/herself  if they
have any doubt regarding the question.

The portal will be designed in such a manner that the after the start of the examination the student 
wont have any option to toggle around different windows or apps, hence the student cant exit from the 
exam and the only option to exit before time will be to end the session. 
The particular assessment will be connceted to a remote server which would be saving the students sessions 
every minute so that by any chance if any inconvience is caused the student wont have to worry about the
attempted questions and also the system would be intelligent enough to give that extra time which was wasted.

The administrator will have an eye on each and every student during the examination and also the mischief
movements of the students would be visible to them and they would have an option to give them a warning
and if after that also student continues the admin panel can just terminate the exam of that student.
The report of each and every student would be auto generated by the system so the authorities can have 
a clear understanding of the questions attempted.
